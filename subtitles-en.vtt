00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
Now that you've run
your first program,

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.760
I'd like to share
with you some tips

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.590
for learning to code.

4
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.180
First is, do try the code.

5
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.020
Do pause the videos
and do run the code.

6
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.740
To test your understanding
of how line of code works,

7
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.720
try asking yourself
questions like,

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.260
what do I think will
happen if I leave

9
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.660
a quotation mark out or if I

10
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.740
accidentally have two instead of

11
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.360
one closing parentheses
and then change the code,

12
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.800
run it and see if you are right.

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.040
To give yourself practice,

14
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.505
I also encourage you to complete
the practice exercises.

15
00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.980
I also encourage you to use

16
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.980
a chatbot as often as you want.

17
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.380
Think of the AI chatbot
as your buddy or

18
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.280
your coding companion who knows

19
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.640
Python pretty well
and is patient,

20
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.100
and just wants to help you out.

21
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.640
While going through this course,

22
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.980
you might think of some
what if or why questions.

23
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.180
What if I did that?
Why is it like that?

24
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.080
Go ahead and ask the chatbot

25
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.000
as many questions as you want.

26
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.220
You can also ask your
chatbot to explain

27
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.540
codes and sometimes ask you,
how does this code work?

28
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.540
What is it doing
that might help you

29
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.815
understand what a piece of
code is actually doing?

30
00:01:13.815 --> 00:01:15.720
This is actually
what professional

31
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.120
software developers
do today as well.

32
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.580
When there's a piece of
code, I don't understand.

33
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.240
I will paste it into

34
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.220
chatbot sometimes and see
if it can help me out.

35
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.200
When you're coding and
running code is totally

36
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.020
fine if something doesn't
work the first time round,

37
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.160
[inaudible] code are
completely expected.

38
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.380
After all, this may be a
brand new language for you,

39
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.660
and as when you're learning to

40
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.300
speak Spanish or French
for the first time,

41
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.060
you won't say everything
right the first time round.

42
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880
We should expect
to say when you're

43
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.700
learning a new
programming language.

44
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.930
You won't get everything
right the first time round.

45
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.550
If it doesn't work
the first time

46
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.470
around, that's totally fine.

47
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.530
Just try a different
approach if you can think of

48
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.300
one or ask the chatbot for help.

49
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.630
In fact, the chatbot
can also help

50
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.330
you read and understand
error messages.

51
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.130
Finally, instead of just
copy pasting answers

52
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.150
from the chatbot into your code,

53
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.300
consider also reading the
chatbot's response to

54
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.390
see if the chatbot can share
of your new perspective,

55
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.990
or teach you something rather

56
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.780
than just give you the answer.

57
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.010
That way hopefully,
you also keep on

58
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.770
deepening your
understanding of coding.

59
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.590
I hope you feel free to
learn at your own pace.

60
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.630
Pause the videos what you want.

61
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.390
When I'm learning online,

62
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.690
I often pause the video when

63
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.170
I feel like I need
to think and then

64
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.530
come back only when I

65
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.590
feel like I've gotten
one to move on,

66
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.770
and feel free to go
as fast or as slow as

67
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.050
you want to make sure

68
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.410
you're understanding
these concepts.

69
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.850
Learning to code is really fun,

70
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.390
and I hope these tips make

71
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.970
this even more
enjoyable for you.

72
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.810
With that, let's go on to

73
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.750
the next video on
data in Python.
